  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, I feel like it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve made a blog post. I guess in the blog world 9 days is an eternity. I had planned to make a couple blog posts last week but I was just too busy cramming new concepts into my head to have time.
Aside from concept cramming I think the highlight of the week was <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/codeday/">Ladies Learning Code</a> National Code day. I spent the day mentoring a class full of eager first time coders. All I can say is that teaching is incredibly rewarding. Knowing you helped make those &lsquo;Eureka&rsquo; moments happen is a really good feeling. I&rsquo;m really grateful to Ladies Learning Code for giving me the opportunity to give something back to the Web Development community.</p>

<p>Aside from teaching people to code, LLC is really great at throwing parties. Saturday night was an eye opener for me. Coming from my background working at bars it&rsquo;s refreshing to be in a community of people that I not only am excited to work with, but to be friends with as well.</p>

<p>As far as learning things go, I spent a ton of time this week wrestling with grunt. Before I started working on my second project I set my mind to including some kind of html importing engine into the gruntfile generated by generator-webapp. Now for someone new to this whole automation thing generator-webapps gruntfile is actually quite confusing (I think grunt configuration is a little confusing by nature). I started out with grunt-includes and after several hours of fiddling I decided to scrap the whole thing and take the advice of Drew Minns. I jumped into Jade. I was actually going to make a blog post about how to add Jade to generator-webapp (there are a few good posts out there but they are all a little outdated). The only problem with that is that when I went to use grunt to build my distribution version everything was completely screwed. I had to disable grunt-rev and copy a lot of things over by hand in order to make it work. Eventually I did get the site up and running, and if you&rsquo;d like to take a look you can see it <a href="http://seethruhead/proj2">here.</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sure that my next big personal project is going to be creating an iterative development environment that I fully understand using a more (IMHO) intuitive task runner: Gulp.</p>

<p>There will be a blog post to accompany that once it&rsquo;s complete. So stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So day four just wrapped up at <a href="https://twitter.com/hackeryou">@HackerYou</a> and because I was fortunate enough to have taken the part-time course previously most of the lessons have been review. So I spent most of the time fiddling around with tooling. Today I focused my efforts on adding some customizations to Sublime and devtools and fixing a few annoyances that have come up in class.</p>

<h3>Devtools</h3>

<p>I recently ran across a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/pixelpurity/status/502225973295992832">@pixelpurity</a> showing off a matching inspector and sublime text. But when I set out to recreate it I ran into a few issues. My researching took me to <a href="http://darcyclarke.me/">Darcy Clarke&rsquo;s blog</a> where he outlined how to do it. Unfortunately the feature has since been removed. You can now only load custom css for the Chrome inspector via a chrome extension. Now I couldn&rsquo;t find (still can&rsquo;t actually) the base16-eighties-dark theme as a chrome extension but I did find a tool that could help build one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, It&rsquo;s finally here. When I leave the house tomorrow it won&rsquo;t be to slog out another 8 hour day serving shitty drinks to degenerates. Tomorrow I start a full time immersive Front-End bootcamp at <a href="https://twitter.com/hackeryou">@HackerYou</a>. It&rsquo;s hard to believe this is actually happening. It may sound like I&rsquo;m overhyping it, or just overly excited. But if someone had asked me what my life plan was 6 months ago I wouldn&rsquo;t of had an answer for them. University is far too expensive and I feel like college is worth so little that it doesn&rsquo;t justify the amount of time put into it. I really had no idea how I was going to gain the knowledge needed to pursue a fulfilling career.</p>

<p>So it suffices to say that I&rsquo;m incredibly excited. (I&rsquo;ve probably mentioned this in every blog post so far haven&rsquo;t I&hellip;)</p>

<p>I really can&rsquo;t wait to meet my new instructors and to see the instructors/mentors from my part time class again. Just the thought of spending 8 hours a day in class with people as determined as I am to learn something new is a refreshing thought when compared to how I&rsquo;ve spent most of my days over the past few years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has been a while coming. I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;ve actually been dreading it. I&rsquo;m a terrible writer and have been so incredibly out of practice for so long that the whole idea has been a bit daunting.</p>

<p>Now with that out of the way I suppose I&rsquo;ll move on to the meat of the post. I&rsquo;m a 27 year old Toronto native who&rsquo;s been working in the service industry for about 7 years now. Partly due to my own laziness I&rsquo;ve not really progressed at all in those 7 years. I&rsquo;ve mostly just wasted time.</p>

<p>So I recently made the decision to put it all behind me and take a risk on something new. The first step was to enroll in a <a href="http://www.hackeryou.com">HackerYou</a> part time Intro to HTML &amp; CSS course that I discovered while researching coding bootcamps. I was barely able to afford cost of tution by working at an after hours bar in the city. Let me tell you, I enjoyed that class more than anything I&rsquo;ve done in a long long while. It was easily worth every penny. I came out of it with a decent understanding of HTML and CSS and a hunger to learn more.</p>
